Building same dataframe as flows_in but with County Name, State column added for relevant rows

Mapping Flows (have to load in all top 10 states)
```{r}
va_points <- tracts("VA", class = "sf")
md_points <- tracts("MD", class = "sf")
dc_points <- tracts("DC", class = "sf")

ny_points <- tracts("NY", class = "sf")
oh_points <- tracts("OH", class = "sf")
sc_points <- tracts("SC", class = "sf")
fl_points <- tracts("FL", class = "sf")
```

only do states and counties given by top 10 graphs

Doing states first:
(in flows)
```{r}
flows_in_state <- flows_in[flows_in$h_state != "51", ] %>%
  group_by(h_state, w_state) %>%
  summarise(S000 = sum(S000)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(-S000)
#get states names
flows_in_state <- flows_in_state[1:10, ]
flows_in_state$State <- c("Maryland", "District of Columbia", "West Virginia", "Pennsylvania", "North Carolina", "New Jersey", "New York", "Ohio", "South Carolina", "Florida")

states_flow_lines <-st_as_sf(od2line(flows_in_state, states()[3:10]))
tmap_mode("view")
pal <- viridis::viridis(n = 3, option = "C")
top10states_flowsmap <- tm_shape(states_flow_lines %>% select(State, w_state, S000, geometry)) +
  tm_lines(lwd = 3.5, 
           col = "S000",

           style = "quantile",
           palette = c("#60999A", "#E57200"),
           popup.vars = c("Number of Jobs" = "S000")) +
  tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap.HOT") +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(5, 18), basemaps.alpha = 0.5)
top10states_flowsmap
```


Doing VA Counties now:
```{r}

#join with names of h_county

essential <- va_xw %>%

essential$cty <- as.character(essential$cty)
flows_in_VA_cnty <- inner_join(x = flows_in_VA_cnty, y = unique(essential), by = c("h_stcty" = "cty"))

  tm_lines(lwd = 3.5, col = "S000", title.col = "Number of Jobs", style = "quantile",
           palette = c("#60999A", "#E57200"),

  tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap.HOT") +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(8, 18), basemaps.alpha = 0.5)
top10VA_cnty_flowsmap
```

Doing counties outside of VA now:
```{r}
top_ten_with_names$h_stcty <- substr(top_ten_with_names$h_geocode_tract, 1, 5)

                                 zone_code = "h_stcty")
