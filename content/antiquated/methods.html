<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Key questions to address about data:Â  what is the dataset who produces/owns the dataset what year(s) are available and what year(s) we used who/what does the dataset capture (what is the unit of analysis) what level of geography does the data have why did we use the dataset what information from the dataset did we use</p>
<p><a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/">American Community Survey</a></p>
<p>The American community Survey provides detailed sociodemographic and socioeconomic information about American households, provided by the US Census Bureau annually. The five-year estimates are available beginning in 2005/09 to present; we use the 2014/18 dataset for our analyses. The data are presented on multiple geography levels including block group, tract, county, and state; our research is interested in tract level information. We used the dataset to characterize the Fairfax County workforce, for example, to locate which tracts had a higher percentage of near retirement population or to create composite indicators identifying where workers are located who may be vulnerable to job loss.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<div id="exploratory-methods" class="section level5">
<h5>Exploratory Methods</h5>
<p><strong>Workforce Characterisitics</strong></p>
<p>First, we characterized the workforce in Fairfax County at the tract-level. The LODES Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC) data presents the number of jobs totaled by work Census block for sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables, including age, earnings, job sector, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, sex, firm age, and firm size. We aggregate these variables to the tract-level and summarize using pie and bar charts in RStudio.</p>
<p>The American Community Survey (ACS) also provides information on the Fairfax County workforce. Specifically, we use the 2014/18 ACS five-year estimates to determine transportation means and ages of Fairfax County workers. We use the leaflet package for RStudio to plot these tract-level findings.</p>
<p><strong>Residence Characterisitics</strong></p>
<p>While the WAC data characterizes workers whose workplaces are located in Fairfax County, the LODES Residence Area Characteristics (RAC) data characterizes workers whose homes are located in Fairfax County. For the RAC data, the number of jobs are totaled by home Census block; we aggregate the data to tract-level. The RAC dataset reports the number of workers by age, earnings, job sector, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, and sex. We summarize these variables using pie and bar charts in RStudio.</p>
<p>The ACS data also provides information on the Fairfax County residents; we use the 2014/18 ACS five-year estimates. We visualize ACS data on worker commutes, classes, and industries at the tract-level using the leaflet package in RStudio.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerable Areas</strong></p>
<p>To describe vulnerable areas in Fairfax County, we use ACS tract-level data and the VirginiaWorks' Initial Unemployment Claims datasets.</p>
<p>The vulnerability measure highlights tracts where workers are most susceptible to COVID-19 job loss. We used a Brookings report to identify the major factors contributing to covid-related economic hardship, due to the pandemic exacerbating these underlying vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>We calculate vulnerability using the following information as a percentage:</p>

<p>We map the results using leaflet. We compute quintile cut-offs for each indicator. Tract placement in a higher quintile indicates higher relative vulnerability; conversely, placement in a lower quintile indicates lower relative vulnerability.</p>
<p>Additionaly, the Virginia Employment Commission provides Initial Unemployment Claims data at the zip code level. We ensure the data is mappable using data from <a href="https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips">simplemaps</a>, and map the results at a zip code level using leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>Emerging Areas</strong></p>
<p>To explore emerging areas, create a map that displays the LODES Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC) and Fortune 1000 companies. Specifically, we checked the <a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/35-virginia-companies-make-2020-fortune-1000-list/">Virginia Business Newsletter</a> for the companies in Fairfax County that made the Fortune 1000 list. Next, we Google-searched the businesses for their addresses, and used the package tidygeocoder in RStudio to geocode each headquarter. Next we mapped the WAC data on the tract-level using leaflet, which indicates workplace destination tracts. Markers were mapped using the geocoded latitude/longitude data for the Fortune 1000 companies. This map visualizes where large employers may be located.</p>
<p><strong>Tyson's Corner Case Study</strong></p>
<p>We used CoStar data provided by Fairfax County to understand properties in Tyson's Corner. In the future, we will be able to use features in the costar property data like property square footage vs number of employees or number of elevators vs number of employees to begin to answer some of the questions that the stakeholders have about what the future of the workplace may look like in Fairfax County.</p>

<div id="network-analysis" class="section level5">
<h5>Network Analysis</h5>
<p>We employed network analysis to understand the relationships between where Fairfax County residents work and reside at the Census tract level. Networks are made up of nodes and edges. Nodes are the &quot;dots&quot;, and edges are the &quot;lines&quot;, or relationships between nodes. Weights are represented by the thickness of an edge, in otherwords, weights describe the strength of a connection from node to node. Finally, we use a directed graph, which means that the edges have a direction, and can be conceptualized as an arrow.</p>
<p>The LODES data is produced by the US Census Bureau in order to better understand where workers reside and work. There are three main datasets of the LODES data; we use the Origin-Destination (OD) files for our networks. These datasets are available for 2002-2017, but we only use the 2010-2017 datasets. The OD datasets indicate where individuals work and reside by Census Block Code. We attain the main and aux OD files. The main files include jobs for which the residence and workplace are both in-state; the aux files include jobs for which the workplace is in-state while the residence is out-of-state. We combine both the main and aux files, and we aggregate the data by Census tract. Our data profiling of residents deriving from outside of Fairfax County revealed that some workers live in states well outside of driving distance. This created a challenge that makes it hard to determine whether workers work for businesses with headquarters in Fairfax but work elsewhere or whether they do work in Fairfax only part of the time. For these reasons, we decided to only focus on flows deriving from within Fairfax County. The LODES OD data is produced for three aggregations: total jobs, federal jobs, and private jobs. The federal jobs tables are only available through 2015.</p>
<p>Following the network framework, in our project, the nodes are Census tracts, and the edges are counts of workers who live in a given tract and work in a given tract. The strength is defined by the number of jobs, and is further specified into the categories below. We only use one of the weight variables at a time. We define the direction FROM residence Census tract to workplace Census tract.</p>

<p><strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong></p>
<p>For the network analysis, we used the LODES data to construct an edgelist to examine how workers living within Fairfax County travel from tracts where they live to tracts where they work. Our first step of analysis is to produce network-level descriptive statistics, so that we understand the basic structural components of the graph as a whole. We ran an extensive set of descriptive statistic measures using the igraph package for RStudio. The key descriptive statistics and applications are defined below:</p>
<table style="width:61%;">

<col width="12%" />
<col width="18%" />
<col width="30%" />

<tr class="odd">

<td></td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Measures of Centrality</strong></p>
<p>The next step of the analysis is to view the node measures of centrality. While we eventually plan to conduct some machine learning on a broader collection of network centrality measures, our short-term goal was just to see which Census tracts are most important when analyzing them as a network. We use leaflet maps to visualize the four measures of centrality defined below:</p>
<table style="width:61%;">

<tr class="odd">

<td>Number of jobs for which individuals depart to get to their jobs in other tracts</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Weighted In-Degree Centrality</td>
<td>Weighted number of ties directed toward the node</td>
<td>Number of jobs for which the tract is the work destination</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Betwenness Centrality</td>
<td>Measures if the node lies on the paths to other nodes</td>
<td>Measures if the tract lies on paths between other tracts</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Eigenvector Centrality</td>
<td>Measures importance of a node based on if neighboring nodes have many connections</td>
<td>Measures importance of a tract based on if neighboring tracts have many connections</td>
</tr>
