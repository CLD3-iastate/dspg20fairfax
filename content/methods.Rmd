### Data

Key questions to address about data:Â 
what is the dataset
who produces/owns the dataset
what year(s) are available and what year(s) we used
who/what does the dataset capture (what is the unit of analysis)
what level of geography does the data have
why did we use the dataset
what information from the dataset did we use

[American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) 

The American community Survey provides detailed sociodemographic and socioeconomic information about American households, provided by the US Census Bureau annually. The five-year estimates are available beginning in 2005/09 to present; we use the 2014/18 dataset for our analyses. The data are presented on multiple geography levels including block group, tract, county, and state; our research is interested in tract level information. We used the dataset to characterize the Fairfax County workforce, for example, to locate which tracts had a higher percentage of near retirement population or to create composite indicators identifying where workers are located who may be vulnerable to job loss.

### Methods

##### Exploratory Methods

__Workforce Characterisitics__

First, we characterized the workforce in Fairfax County at the tract-level. The LODES Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC) data presents the number of jobs totaled by work Census block for sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables, including age, earnings, job sector, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, sex, firm age, and firm size. We aggregate these variables to the tract-level and summarize using pie and bar charts in RStudio. 

The American Community Survey (ACS) also provides information on the Fairfax County workforce. Specifically, we use the 2014/18 ACS five-year estimates to determine transportation means and ages of Fairfax County workers. We use the leaflet package for RStudio to plot these tract-level findings.

__Residence Characterisitics__

While the WAC data characterizes workers whose workplaces are located in Fairfax County, the LODES Residence Area Characteristics (RAC) data characterizes workers whose homes are located in Fairfax County. For the RAC data, the number of jobs are totaled by home Census block; we aggregate the data to tract-level. The RAC dataset reports the number of workers by age, earnings, job sector, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, and sex. We summarize these variables using pie and bar charts in RStudio. 

The ACS data also provides information on the Fairfax County residents; we use the 2014/18 ACS five-year estimates. We visualize ACS data on worker commutes, classes, and industries at the tract-level using the leaflet package in RStudio. 

__Vulnerable Areas__

To describe vulnerable areas in Fairfax County, we use ACS tract-level data and the VirginiaWorks' Initial Unemployment Claims datasets.

The vulnerability measure highlights tracts where workers are most susceptible to COVID-19 job loss. We used a Brookings report to identify the major factors contributing to covid-related economic hardship, due to the pandemic exacerbating these underlying vulnerabilities.

We calculate vulnerability using information on percent:

Description | ACS Table Code
-----------|-----------------
Unemployed | B23025
Part-time Workers | B23022
HS or less for Employed Population 16+ | B23006
Median Income for Civilian Employed Population 16+ |  B24011
Employed in Occupations Impacted by COVID (Services) | C24060
Employed in Industries Impacted by COVID ("Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation, and Accommodation and Food Services"; "Retail Trade"; "Other Services Except Public Administration") | C24050

We map the results using leaflet. We compute quintile cut-offs for each indicator. Tract placement in a higher quintile indicates higher relative vulnerability; conversely, placement in a lower quintile indicates lower relative vulnerability.

Additionaly, the Virginia Employment Commission provides Initial Unemployment Claims data at the zip code level. We ensure the data is mappable using data from [simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips), and map the results at a zip code level using leaflet.

##### Network Analysis

We employed network analysis to understand the relationships between where Fairfax County residents work and reside at the Census tract level. Networks are made up of nodes and edges. Nodes are the "dots", and edges are the "lines", or relationships between nodes. Weights are represented by the thickness of an edge, in otherwords, weights describe the strength of a connection from node to node. Finally, we use a directed graph, which means that the edges have a direction, and can be conceptualized as an arrow.  

The LODES data is produced by the US Census Bureau in order to better understand where workers reside and work. There are three main datasets of the LODES data; we use the Origin-Destination (OD) files for our networks. These datasets are available for 2002-2017, but we only use the 2010-2017 datasets. The OD datasets indicate where individuals work and reside by Census Block Code. We attain the main and aux OD files. The main files include jobs for which the residence and workplace are both in-state; the aux files include jobs for which the workplace is in-state while the residence is out-of-state. We combine both the main and aux files, and we aggregate the data by Census tract, and restrict the tracts to intra-Fairfax tracts only.The LODES OD data is produced for three aggregations: total jobs, federal jobs, and private jobs. The federal jobs tables are only available through 2015.

Following the network framework, in our project, the nodes are Census tracts, and the edges are counts of workers who live in a given tract and work in a given tract. The strength is defined by the number of jobs, and is further specified into the categories below. We only use one of the weight variables at a time.
We define the direction FROM residence Census tract to workplace Census tract.

Variable | Description
---------------|-------------------
w_geocode_tract | Workplace Census Tract
h_geocode_tract | Residence Census Tract
S000 | Total number of jobs
SI01 | Number of jobs in Goods Producing industry sectors
SI02 | Number of jobs in Trade, Transportation, and Utilities industry sectors
SI03 | Number of jobs in All Other Services industry sectors

__Descriptive Statistics__

Our first step of network analysis is to produce network-level descriptive statistics, so that we understand the basic structural components of the graph as a whole. We ran an extensive set of descriptive statistic measures using the igraph package for RStudio. The key descriptive statistics and applications are defined below: 

Measure | Definition | Fairfax Application
--------|------------|---------------------
Order | Number of nodes | Number of tracts
Size | Number of edges | Residence-workplace relationship between tracts
Average Degree | Average number of adjacent edges | Average count of residence-workplace relationships for each Census tract
Average Betweenness | Average number of shortest paths going through a node |
Diameter | Greatest distance between two nodes |   
Edge density | Ratio of the number of edges to the the number of possible edges | Measures sparseness or density of residence-workplace relationships
Transitivity | The probability that the adjacent nodes are connected |

__Measures of Centrality__

The next step of the analysis is to view the node measures of centrality. This helps us understand residence-workplace flows at the the tract-level:

Measure | Definition | Fairfax Application
--------|------------|---------------------
Weighted Out-Degree Centrality | Weighted number of ties directed away from the node | Number of jobs for which individuals depart to get to their jobs in other tracts
Weighted In-Degree Centrality | Weighted number of ties directed toward the node | Number of jobs for which the tract is the work destination
Betwenness Centrality | Measures if the node lies on the paths to other nodes | Measures if the tract lies on paths between other tracts
Eigenvector Centrality | Measures importance of a node based on if neighboring nodes have many connections | Measures importance of a tract based on if neighboring tracts have many connections
