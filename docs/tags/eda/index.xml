      <description>/* this chunnk of code centers all of the headings */ h1, h2, h3, h4 { text-align: center; }  Approach This page characterizes the Fairfax County workforce. To do this, we used two datasets to better understand the population of individuals with job locations in Fairfax County. LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) data provide worker race, ethnicity, education, gender, and industry data at census block group level. We retrieved these characteristics from the 2017 LODES data, which we summarized at the workplace county level to provide an overview of Fairfax County&#39;s workforce.</description>

      <description>/* this chunnk of code centers all of the headings */ h1, h2, h3, h4 { text-align: center; }  Approach To prepare for an analysis of Fairfax County job flows, we wanted to better understand the geographic origins of workers who reside in other localities but work in Fairfax County. We examined flows to Fairfax County from within Virginia, from other states, and from counties in other states to identify localities that send the highest number of workers to Fairfax County.</description>
